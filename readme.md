# Communion

This is a short story I've written and illustrated, that you can play in your browser via [Github Pages](https://aidanparkhurst.github.io/Communion/)

It uses p5.js for rendering and audio, and you can host it locally by cloning this repo, then starting the express server with: ``node ./server.js``.
